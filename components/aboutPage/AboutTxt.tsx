        <h2>Our Story:</h2>
        <p>
          Founded 2016, Skomantes keramika is the culmination of a lifelong love
          affair with ceramics. It all started with Skomante, who, fueled by a
          passion for creativity and a deep connection to the art of pottery,
          decided to turn a personal hobby into a thriving business. What began
          as a humble studio has now blossomed into a bustling ceramics haven,
          attracting both local enthusiasts and art lovers from afar.
